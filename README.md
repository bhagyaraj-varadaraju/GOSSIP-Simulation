Use the following cmds to run project:
* chmod +x project2.sh
* ./project2.sh numNodes topology algorithm\
Where numNodes is the number of actors to spawn, topology is one of (full, line, twoD, imp2D), the algorithm is one of (gossip, pushsum).

Working:

1. Convergence of Gossip algorithm for given topologies: line,full, 2D, Imperfect2D
2. Convergence of Push Sum algorithm for all topologies
